# Creating virtual environment is a good approach when working on different
# projects.

# Python Virtual Environment
# The virtual environment allows you to work in a contained environment
# without affecting the system Python. Each virtual environment has its
# directory or folder that contains:
# 1. Python installation for a particular version.
# Suppose you are working on a project, where you have to install a package
# that only works on a specific Python version, you create a virtual
# environment and install the Python version needed to install this package.
# Beware any Python version you want to install in a virtual environment,
# first you should install it in your system.

# 2. Packages or libraries that are needed in your project. This setup allows
# you to manage dependencies for different projects separately, avoiding
# conflicts between them.
# Suppose you are working on two different projects where each one of them
# uses different packages or each one of them uses the same package but with
# different versions.
